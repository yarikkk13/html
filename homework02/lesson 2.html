        Keanu Charles Reeves, whose first name means "cool breeze over the mountains" in Hawaiian, was born September 2,
        1964 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is the son of Patricia Taylor, a showgirl and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin
        Reeves, a geologist. Keanu's father was born in Hawaii, of British, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and Chinese
        ancestry, and Keanu's mother is originally from England. After his parents' marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with
        his
        mother and younger sister, Kim Reeves, to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 was Paul Aaron, a stage and
        film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock
        promoter
        Robert Miller and hair salon owner Jack Bond. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father. In high
        school,
        Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the
        nickname
        "The Wall") and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career.
