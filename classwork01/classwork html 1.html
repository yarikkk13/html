    The Matrix is a 1999 American science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis, and
    produced by Joel Silver. It stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe
    Pantoliano and is the first installment in the Matrix franchise. It depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is
    unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality, the Matrix, created by intelligent machines to distract humans while
    using their bodies as an energy source. When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias "Neo",
    uncovers the truth, he "is drawn into a rebellion against the machines" along with other people who have been
    freed from the Matrix.
