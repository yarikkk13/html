    series consists of a three movies, beginning with The Matrix (1999) and continuing with two sequels, The Matrix
    Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions (both in 2003), all written and directed by the Wachowskis and produced by Joel

    The series depicts a future in which Earth is dominated by a race of self-aware machines that was spawned from the
    creation of artificial intelligence early in the 21st century. At one point conflict arose between mankind and
    machines, and the machines rebelled against their creators. Mankind attempted to block out the machines' source of
    solar power by covering the sky in thick, stormy clouds. A massive war emerged between the two adversaries which
    ended with the machines victorious, capturing mankind. Having lost their definite source of energy, the machines
    devised a way to extract the human body's bioelectric and thermal energies by enclosing people in pods, while their
    minds are controlled by cybernetic implants connecting them to a simulated reality called the Matrix.
